# Jahnavi Maddhuri: Cloud Hosted Notebook and Data Manipulation
This project was originally started for the course, IDS 702: Data Engineering.
The purpose of this project is to analyze a dataset using pandas and a cloud hosted notebook in a python project template with a strong build system. This creates a base feedback loop every time I update my project.
